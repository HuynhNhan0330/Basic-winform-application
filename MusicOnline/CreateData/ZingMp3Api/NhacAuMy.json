sides to a story\nBut they never tell my side\nNever been the kinda guy\nTo stay inside the guidelines\nI know I'm the bad guy\nI don't gotta ask why\nIf you try to step to me\nIt'll be the last time\nI got dirt on my name\nSix feet in the ground\nI got people in my past\nTry bringin' me down\nSay I'm losin' my mind\nI don't wanna be found\nGrew up in the shadow\nBut I know they watchin' me now\nParanoia, on-the-go\nI'm moving silent\nPull up on ya\nI got trouble right behind me\nBite the bullet, suit and tie\nThe silver linin'\nI'ma show you how to crash a party\nEvery time you pop off\nThey hopin' that you fall hard\nThey prayin' for the death of a rockstar\nEverybody hatin' ever since you got more\nThey prayin' for the death of a rockstar\nThey love it when you lost boy\nNow the low life at the top floor\nEverybody hatin' ever since you got more\nThey prayin' for the death of a rockstar\nThey talk about me, I forget to listen\nAt least I get the recognition\nHeavyweight, I pull up on you\nWith the repetition\nYou in the pit\nIt's not no exhibition\nOh, they big mad\nI'm the big boss\nTalk a big game, take a big loss\nGrowin' up, I was the problem\nThat they didn't solve\nI'm the piece\nThat wouldn't fit inside the jigsaw\nI got a lotta punch lines\nAnd a quick jab\nI'm runnin' straight through\nI don't gotta zigzag\nI got a heavy heart\nIt's hard to lift

good night\nWith a rose\nHoping that the Eiffel falls, of course\nYou don't understand the life we chose\nI need my silence\nMy privacy so I can heal\nAnd even rockstars got feelings\nThat they feel\nIn reality, this just repeats like a drill\nAlways, oh-oh, oh-oh\nEvery time you pop off\nThey hopin' that you fall hard\nThey prayin' for the death of a rockstar\nEverybody hatin' ever since
