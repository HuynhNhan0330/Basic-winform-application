high all my life \nTo forget I'm missing you\nOoh-ooh ooh-ooh \nPick up daddies at the playground \nHow I spend my day time\nLoosen up the frown\nMake them feel alive\nOh make it fast and greasy\nI'm numb and way too easy\nYou're gone and I gotta stay \nHigh all the time\nTo keep you off my mind \nOoh-ooh ooh-ooh \nHigh all the time\nTo keep you off my mind\nOoh-ooh ooh-ooh \nSpend my days locked in a haze \nTrying to forget you babe \nI fall back down\nGotta stay high all my life\nTo forget I'm missing you\nOoh-ooh ooh-ooh \nStaying in my play pretend\nWhere the fun ain't got no end \nCan't go home alone again\nNeed someone to numb the pain\nStaying in my play pretend\nWhere the fun ain't got no end \nCan't go home alone again\nNeed someone to numb the pain\nYou're gone and I gotta stay \nHigh all the time\nTo keep you off my mind\nOoh-ooh ooh-ooh \nHigh all the time\nTo keep you off my mind\nOoh-ooh ooh-ooh \nSpend my days locked in a haze \nTrying to forget you babe \nI fall back
